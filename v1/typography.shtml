<p>I've opened a door here that I regret. I'm afraid I just blue myself. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. No… but I'd like to be asked!</p>
<p>That's why you always leave a note! I've opened a door here that I regret. <strong> I don't criticize you!</strong> <em> And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</em> That's why you always leave a note!</p>
<p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Across from where? Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!</p>

	<li>I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children</li>
	<li>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</li>

    <li>And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</li>
