<p>I've opened a door here that I regret. I'm afraid I just blue myself. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. No… but I'd like to be asked!</p>
<p>That's why you always leave a note! I've opened a door here that I regret. <strong> I don't criticize you!</strong> <em> And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</em> That's why you always leave a note!</p>
<p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Across from where? Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!</p>

    <li>I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.</li>
	<li>I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children</li>
	<li>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</li>
</ul>
<ol>

    <li>And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</li>
	<li>I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.</li>
	<li>A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</li>
<li>Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
<ul>
<li>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</li>
</ul>

<li>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</li>

<h1>Noooooo!</h1>
<p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. One hundred dollars. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
<p>I'll get my kit! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. <strong> Throw her in the brig.</strong> <em> These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable.</em> I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p>
<h2>Daylight and everything.</h2>
<p>Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Why would I want to know that? Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</li>
	<li>What are their names?</li>
	<li>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</li>

</ol>

<h3>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hello Morbo, how's the family?</li>
	<li>Bender, quit destroying the universe!</li>
	<li>Who are those horrible orange men?</li>
</ul>

<p>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. No argument here. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</p>
<p>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Okay, I like a challenge. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</p>
<p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Look, last night was a mistake.</p>

<h3>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</h3>
<p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? No! The cat shelter's on to me. Actually, that's still true. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
